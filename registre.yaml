  dcat:themeTaxonomy: # DCAT
    definition: |
      A knowledge organization system (KOS) used to classify the resources documented in the catalog (e.g., datasets and
      services).
    domain: [dcat:Catalog]
    range: [rdfs:Resource]
    comment: |
      It is recommended that the taxonomy is organized in a skos:ConceptScheme, skos:Collection, owl:Ontology or similar,
      which allows each member to be denoted by an IRI and published as Linked Data. 
  dcat:theme:
    definition: A main category of the resource. A resource can have multiple themes.
    subpropertyOf: [dcterms:subject]
    range: [rdfs:Resource]
    comment: |
      Usage note: The set of themes used to categorize the resources are organized in a skos:ConceptScheme, skos:Collection, owl:Ontology or similar, describing all the categories and their relations in the catalog.
  dcat:resource:
    definition: A resource that is listed in the catalog.
    subpropertyOf: [dcterms:hasPart]
    domain: [dcat:Catalog]

  dcat:bbox:
    definition: The geographic bounding box of a spatial thing [SDW-BP].
    range: [rdfs:Literal]
    comment: |
      Usage note:	The range of this property (rdfs:Literal) is intentionally generic, with the purpose of allowing different geometry literal encodings. E.g., the geometry could be encoded as a WKT literal (geosparql:wktLiteral [GeoSPARQL]).
  dcat:centroid:
    definition: The geographic center (centroid) of a spatial thing [SDW-BP].
    range: [rdfs:Literal]

  dcat:landingPage:
    definition: |
      A Web page that can be navigated to in a Web browser to gain access to the catalog, a dataset, its distributions
      and/or additional information.
    subpropertyOf: [foaf:page]
    range: [foaf:Document]
    comment: |
      Usage note: If the distribution(s) are accessible only through a landing page (i.e., direct download URLs are not known),
        then the landing page link SHOULD be duplicated as dcat:accessURL on a distribution.
  dcat:inSeries:
    definition: A dataset series of which the dataset is part.
    domain: [dcat:Dataset]
    range: [dcat:DatasetSeries]

      A URL of the resource that gives access to a distribution of the dataset. E.g., landing page, feed, SPARQL endpoint.
    domain: [dcat:Distribution]
    range: [rdfs:Resource]
    comment: |
      Usage note:	

      dcat:accessURL SHOULD be used for the URL of a service or location that can provide access to this distribution, typically through a Web form, query or API call.

      dcat:downloadURL is preferred for direct links to downloadable resources.

      If the distribution(s) are accessible only through a landing page (i.e., direct download URLs are not known), then the landing page URL associated with the dcat:Dataset SHOULD be duplicated as access URL on a distribution (see 5.7 Dataset available only behind some Web page).
  dcat:accessService:
    definition: A data service that gives access to the distribution of the dataset
    range: [dcat:DataService]

  dcat:previousVersion:
    definition: The previous version of a resource in a lineage [PAV].
    equivalentProperty: [pav:previousVersion]
    subpropertyOf: [prov:wasRevisionOf]
    inverse: dcat:nextVersion
    comment: |
      This property is meant to be used to specify a version chain, consisting of snapshots of a resource.
      The notion of version used by this property is limited to versions resulting from revisions occurring to a resource as part of its life-cycle. One of the typical cases here is representing the history of the versions of a dataset that have been released over time.
  dcat:hasVersion:
    definition: This resource has a more specific, versioned resource [PAV].
    equivalentProperty: [pav:hasVersion]
    subpropertyOf: [dcterms:hasVersion, prov:generalizationOf]
    comment: |
      Usage note:
        This property is intended for relating a non-versioned or abstract resource to several versioned resources, e.g., snapshots [PAV].

        The notion of version used by this property is limited to versions resulting from revisions occurring to a resource as part of its life-cycle. Therefore, its semantics is more specific than its super-property dcterms:hasVersion, which makes use of a broader notion of version, including editions and adaptations.
  dcat:hasCurrentVersion:
    definition: This resource has a more specific, versioned resource with equivalent content [PAV].
    equivalentProperty: [pav:hasCurrentVersion]
    subpropertyOf: [pav:hasVersion]
    comment: |
      Usage note:
        This property is intended for relating a non-versioned or abstract resource to a single snapshot that can be used as a permalink to indicate the current version of the content [PAV].

        The notion of version used by this property is limited to versions resulting from revisions occurring to a resource as part of its life-cycle.

    definition: The previous resource (before the current one) in an ordered collection or series of resources.
    subpropertyOf: [xhv:prev]
    inverse: dcat:next
    comment: |
      Usage note: 	
        In DCAT this property is used for resources belonging to a dcat:DatasetSeries.
        It is important to note that this property is different from dcat:previousVersion, as it does not denote a previous version of the same resource, but a distinct resource immediately preceding the current one in an ordered collection of resources.
