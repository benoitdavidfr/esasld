https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_Core: |
  The Dublin Core standard originally included two levels: Simple and Qualified.
   - Simple Dublin Core comprised 15 elements;
   - Qualified Dublin Core included three additional elements (Audience, Provenance and RightsHolder),
     as well as a group of element refinements (also called qualifiers) that could refine the semantics of the elements
     in ways that may be useful in resource discovery. 

  Since 2012, the two have been incorporated into the DCMI Metadata Terms as a single set of terms using the RDF data model.
  [https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/]
  The full set of elements is found under the namespace http://purl.org/dc/terms/.
  
  Because the definition of the terms often contains domains and ranges, which may not be compatible with the pre-RDF
  definitions used for the original 15 Dublin Core elements, there is a separate namespace for the original 15 elements
  as previously defined: http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/.

        If the full date is unknown, month and year (YYYY-MM) or just year (YYYY) may be used. Date ranges may be specified
        using ISO 8601 period of time specification in which start and end dates are separated by a '/' (slash) character.

    coverage*: # couverture
      Definition: |
        The spatial or temporal topic of the resource, spatial applicability of the resource, or jurisdiction
        under which the resource is relevant.
      Comment: |
        Spatial topic and spatial applicability may be a named place or a location specified by its geographic coordinates.
        Temporal topic may be a named period, date, or date range. A jurisdiction may be a named administrative entity
        or a geographic place to which the resource applies. Recommended practice is to use a controlled vocabulary
        such as the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names [TGN]. Where appropriate, named places or time periods may be used
        in preference to numeric identifiers such as sets of coordinates or date ranges. Because coverage is so broadly defined,
        it is preferable to use the more specific subproperties Temporal Coverage and Spatial Coverage.
      range:
        - http://purl.org/dc/terms/Location
        - http://purl.org/dc/terms/Period
        - http://purl.org/dc/terms/Jurisdiction

    format*: # format, conformité
      Definition: The file format, physical medium, or dimensions of the resource.
      Comment: |
        Recommended practice is to use a controlled vocabulary where available. For example, for file formats one could use
        the list of Internet Media Types [MIME]. Examples of dimensions include size and duration.
      range:
        - http://purl.org/dc/terms/MediaType
        - http://purl.org/dc/terms/Extent
    medium:

    hasVersion:
      Definition: A related resource that is a version, edition, or adaptation of the described resource.
      Comment: |
        Changes in version imply substantive changes in content rather than differences in format. This property is intended
        to be used with non-literal values. This property is an inverse property of Is Version Of.
    isVersionOf

    provenance:
      Definition: |
